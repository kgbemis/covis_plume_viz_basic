basic notes on creating a plume visualization in MATLAB

code files
	examples.m
	test_viz_par_func.m 

specify full paths to data and bathy in examples.m

several bathy files available at https://github.com/COVIS-Sonar/postprocessing/tree/master/master_program/Inputs
	grid sizes are similar across files
		covis_bathy_2018.mat
		covis_bathy_2019a.mat
		covis_bathy_2019b.mat
	2018 data offset slightly from 2019 data
	usually use 2019b
